# Terms of Use

**Last updated:** February 23, 2026

## Agreement

By using KeychainPGP, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the software.

## What KeychainPGP Is

KeychainPGP is free, open-source software that provides OpenPGP encryption and decryption functionality. It is distributed under the [MIT](LICENSE-MIT) and [Apache-2.0](LICENSE-APACHE) licenses.

## License

KeychainPGP is dual-licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0, at your option. You may use, copy, modify, and distribute the software in accordance with either license. See [LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) and [LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) for full terms.

## No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. The authors and contributors make no guarantees regarding:

- The security or correctness of cryptographic operations
- Fitness for any particular purpose
- Uninterrupted or error-free operation
- Compatibility with any specific system or environment

You use this software at your own risk.

## No Service

KeychainPGP is software, not a service. There are no servers operated by the KeychainPGP project that process your data. All operations happen locally on your device (or in your browser for the WASM version).

## User Responsibility

You are solely responsible for:

- **Key management** — safeguarding your private keys and passphrases. Lost keys cannot be recovered by anyone.
- **Backups** — maintaining backups of your keys and important data.
- **Legal compliance** — ensuring your use of encryption software complies with the laws of your jurisdiction. Cryptographic software may be subject to export controls or usage restrictions in some countries.
- **Recipient verification** — verifying that public keys belong to their claimed owners before encrypting sensitive messages.

## No Data Collection

KeychainPGP does not collect, store, or process any user data on external servers. See our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) for details.

## Third-Party Dependencies

KeychainPGP relies on open-source libraries (including Sequoia-PGP for cryptographic operations). While we make reasonable efforts to use well-maintained dependencies, we do not guarantee the security or correctness of third-party code.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the authors and contributors of KeychainPGP shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use this software, including but not limited to:

- Loss of data or cryptographic keys
- Unauthorized access to decrypted content
- Inability to decrypt messages
- Any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages

## Export Compliance

KeychainPGP includes cryptographic functionality. You are responsible for complying with all applicable export control laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.

## Changes to These Terms

Changes to these terms will be documented in the project's Git history and release notes. Continued use of the software after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
